<h1>Fuck you Venax</h1>

Hi **Venax**! As you can see, I'm recreating your crappy tools. I still don't understand how you can sell this crap for 30$ when you just use Nuitka and on top of that layers of obfuscator when Nuitka does the job very well. You are really pathetic and I don't understand how you can sell crap like this to people and at a very high price when 70% of the project is not you. The worst thing is that you think you are good at programming when you are nothing. On that note, I'll recreate all your projects for free :).

<h1>Ares</h1>

Hello ! You want to use a crappy software of a person called Venax for free? Well, you've come to the right place! At the moment I'm recreating the crap Ares, it doesn't have all the same features yet, but it won't be long before it does. With these few words I will explain how to install the dependencies and how to use this lo crap.

<h1>Step one python</h1>
  
```
To get started, you'll need Python, but I'm assuming you already have it, so let's move on.
```

<h1>Stage two Nuitka</h1>
  
Since this shit uses Nuitka you'll have to install it. To do so use this command ( you must have C++ installed  )
```
pip install nuitka
```
  
<h1>Install C++</h1>

Go to this link and install Visual Studio and then install C++
```
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/
```

<h1>End</h1>
  
Now you just have to download the source code and launch the main .py and then follow the instructions :)

<h1>Summary of Ares</h1>
  
It's very simple it uses **Nuitka** to compile your .exe file and adds several layers of obfuscator like **Pyarmor**. That's all and for the damn sum of 30$ loool

**PS: I didn't bother to recreate this shit, so the code is probably not beautiful to your eyes, but fortunately you don't see the Venax code lol**
Have a nice day
